-> angular: 
	- an angular is a platform and javascript framework
	- for building the single page applications using Html, Css, Bootstrap and Typescript
	- it implements core and optional functionality as a a set of typescript libraries that you import into your applications
	
-> the architecture of an angular relies on certain fundamental concepts:
	terms:
		1. Template
		2. Directive - (meta data)
		3. Component
		4. Injector
		5. Module
		
-> single page applications:
	- an angular is a javascript frontend web framework based on bi-directional ui data binding
	- is used to design single page applications
	- the applications that load a single Html page and only a part of the page will be updated instead of the entire page - based on the user actions (click, hover, drag, etc.)

-> who are implementing the single page applications: 
	- gmail, google maps, airbnb, netflix etc.,
	
-> when angular can use?
	- it's called the safe navigation operator which can be used to prevent angular from throwing errors, when trying to access object properties of an object that doesn't exist
	
-> setup an env., and creating the project:
	- install node and npm - 14v
	- npm install -g @angular/cli
	- ng --version
	
	to create a new project
	- ng new yourappname
		1. routing (y)
		2. style - css (select) / stylus / less / scss
	- ng serve (or) npm starts
	
		
-> to create a responsive: 
	- bootstrap: npm install --save bootstrap
	- in angular.json file: "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
	
-> creating the new custom component
	- adding styles to it
	- declaring the property(s) in side the class defin., of component
	- accessing or interpolation or one way property binding - {{ }}
	
	- to set the component as the landing page 
		1. the name of the component should be declared and needs to specify under bootstrap: [] - app.module.ts
		2. in index.html file - needs to specify the given selector of that component
		
	(or)
	
	- creating new component with command
		- ng generate component <compname>

	
-> property binding: 
	- displaying the value of property in html
	- there are two types: 
		1. one way property binding - {{propertyName}}
		2. two way property binding - user can input the values
			1. template driven 
			2. reactive form
	

-> template driven
	- ngForm
	- ngModel
	
	- (event) = "methodName(parameters)"
	- custome method definition

-> custom (or) template driven form validation
	- modules: FormsModule
	
	- ngForm
	- ngModel
	
	- [(ngModel)]=""
	- #idName="ngModel"
	
	- submitted, invalid
	- errors, errors.invalid
	- errors.email
	- errors.minlength
	
	- [ngClass]="{'is-invalid': ...}"

-> reactive form validation
	- modules: ReactiveFormsModule, 
	- component level modules: FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators

	- [ngClass]
	- *ngIf
	- *ngFor

	
	
-> let's discuss the few differences between template driven and reactive
	- the Template Driven Forms are Asynchronous (Non - Blocking) 
	- whereas, the Reactive Forms are Synchronous (Blocking)

	- in Template Driven most of the 'logic' is driven from the Template
	- in Reactive, the logic resides mainly in the component or typescript code
	
	- the Template Driven approach would be easier or familiar for those who coming from AngularJS v1
	- the Reactive approach removes the core validation logic from the Template and hence make the Template code quite clean
	
-> Creating the Routing in Angular:
	- Enabling Routing and Navigation Service
	- Routing allows users to Navigate between one page (component) to another page (component) based on the action taken by user,
	
	- static: routerLink = "/home"; 
	- in app-routing.module.ts
		{ path: "/home", component: HomeComponent }

	- dynamic: [routerLink] = "/page/:variable"
	
-> Creating the Template or Layout with Custom CSS and Routing
