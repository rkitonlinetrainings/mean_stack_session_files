<h4>Typical web page structure and formatting guidelines</h4>

<p>After years of experimenting, most of us web folks have the best practices of website content nailed down, and we feel like this template covers the bases. Here are a few key elements:</p>

<h5>Headlines</h5>

<p>As with most media, a great headline or page title can make or break a page. But specific to web content, it’s important to remember the SEO aspects. Integrating a major keyword/phrase into a headline and programming the page title with a relevant h1 tag can add some nice Google juice.</p>

<h5>Sub-headlines:</h5>

<p>Visitors scan before they read, so creating enticing, benefits-focused sub-headlines can really boost the odds that your page will be read. I like to run a “scan test” on every page  to see if I can get the gist of page by just scanning the page title, subheads, and call to action.</p>
