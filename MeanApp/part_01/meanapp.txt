	2. if you want, add bootstrap - npm install bootstrap@4.3.1
	3. then, go to app.component.html - add the design with header and output part
	4. we need to create three things: 1. components, 2. model, 3. service
		create the three directories: components/, model/ and service/
	5. create a model - Employee.ts in model/
	6. create a service - api.service.ts in service/
	7. under components/
		1. employee-create
		2. employee-edit
		3. employee-list
